# Font Testing

## `arealglitterboy`

This is a simple site used for comparing and looking at system fonts. Developed mainly for personal use.

### ToDo List:
- [ ] Create a comparison section where you could select fonts and compare them in a more customisable format than google fonts
- [ ] Potentially a section where you could enter some markdown/rich text and allocate variables to it for what fonts could go where, then you could generate demos with different font pairings. Potentially could export css variables to make it easy to go from selecting an aesthetic to designing with it, including font-imports potentially.
- [ ] Develop UI
- [ ] Work on storing the current fonts in `localStorage`.
- [ ] Could potentially link in some other font providers.
- [ ] Lower drawer section that is togglable for comparing selected fonts.
